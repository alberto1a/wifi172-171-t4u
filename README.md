Please see the driver followed
alberto1a/rtl8812AU_8821AU_linux forked from abperiasamy/rtl8812AU_8821AU_linux

It really can work for 3 different wireless adaptors,
   however, remember to forget (delete) the original connections 
   and reboot the computer or reset the router if necessary.
   
It is usually not necessary if exchange between DWA 172 and DWA 171,
   (even reload the driver or reboot the computer.)
   
But it needs to reload the driver when exchenge beetwee tp-link t4u ac1300 and  dwa 171 or dwa 172
    and (reset the router and reboot the computer) when it is dwa 171, but no need for dwa 172.
